HGN.com / DAG (Core)
Welcome to the HGN.com DAG repository, a cutting-edge platform leveraging Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) technology for efficient, scalable, and secure crypto transactions. Our design focuses on minimizing transaction fees while providing high transaction throughput, robust security measures, and ease of use for developers and end-users alike.

Key Features
High Scalability & Efficiency: Implements a DAG structure for fast, parallel transactions without the need for traditional mining.
Advanced Security: Enhanced protection against vulnerabilities like Sybil attacks and double-spending.
Smart Contract Capability: Supports smart contracts, enabling a wide range of decentralized applications.
Sustainability: Prioritizes energy efficiency in its consensus mechanism and transaction validation processes.
Development Highlights
Data Versioning: Utilizes Data Version Control (DVC) for efficient dataset management.
Dynamic DAGs: Supports dynamic adaptation of the DAG structure to meet evolving data and parameter changes.
Robust Error Handling & Logging: Implements comprehensive error handling alongside detailed logging for system integrity and debugging.
Custom Scheduling & Execution Control: Optimizes processing through custom scheduling and effective use of concurrency and parallelism.
Secure Authentication & Authorization: Ensures system security through robust authentication and authorization practices.
External System Integration: Facilitates seamless interoperability with various APIs and services.
